# Day 2 – Client-Server Architecture

## 1. Introduction
The **Client-Server Model** is the foundation of how the Internet works.  
- **Client**: A device or program (browser, mobile app) that requests data or services.  
- **Server**: A computer system that stores, processes, and delivers requested data to the client.  
- **Relationship:** Client asks → Server responds

**Example:**  
You (client) request `google.com` → Google's server responds with the webpage.

## 2. Difference Between Client and Server

| Client (Browser) | Server |
|-----------------|--------|
| Runs on user's device | Runs on remote powerful computer |
| Sends requests for resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images) | Stores website, apps, databases |
| Displays fetched content | Responds to incoming requests |
| Works temporarily | Always online to ensure availability |

## 3. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is the set of rules for sending and receiving data over the Internet.  
It allows browsers and servers to communicate efficiently.

## 4. HTTP Response Cycle (4 Steps)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ Request | Client sends HTTP request to the server |
| 2️⃣ Process | Server reads the request, fetches data from files or database |
| 3️⃣ Response | Server sends data back (HTML, CSS, JS, images) |
| 4️⃣ Render | Browser displays the webpage to the user |

## 5. Real-Life Analogy (Zomato Example)
- **Request:** You order a pizza on Zomato  
- **Process:** Restaurant prepares it  
- **Response:** Delivery boy brings it to you  
- **Render:** You open the box and enjoy it

## 6. Reflection / Takeaways
Understanding this architecture helps in visualizing how websites and apps work behind the scenes.  
From typing a URL to viewing the webpage, it’s all about seamless communication between client and server.
